# Network Load Balancer (NLB) Module

**NOTE**: The `nlb` module has been deprecated and removed as of `v0.15.0`. If you would like to provision an NLB, you
should use the `aws_lb` resource directly instead. If you were using this module before, refer to [the migration
guide](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/module-load-balancer/tree/v0.15.0/_docs/migration_guides/nlb_to_0.15.0) for information on how to update your usage.

For information on why the module was removed, refer to the discussion in [PR
#62](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-load-balancer/pull/62) and [PR
#65](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terraform-aws-load-balancer/pull/65).

# CloudWatch Logs Metric Filter example

This Terraform code shows an example of how to use the [cloudwatch-logs-metric-filters](/modules/logs/cloudwatch-logs-metric-filters) module.

## Quick start

To try these templates out you must have Terraform installed (minimum version: `0.12.6`):

1. Open `vars.tf`, set the environment variables specified at the top of the file, and fill in any other variables that
   don't have a default.
1. Run `terraform init`.
1. Run `terraform plan`.
1. If the plan looks good, run `terraform apply`.

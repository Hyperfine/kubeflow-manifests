This repo contains modules for deploying and managing relational databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and
Aurora on AWS using Amazon's https://aws.amazon.com/rds/[Relational Database Service (RDS)]. It also contains a module
for creating network-attached filesystems on AWS using Amazon's https://aws.amazon.com/efs/[Elastic File System (EFS)], and modules for
configuring https://aws.amazon.com/backup/[AWS Backup].

== Learn

NOTE: This repo is a part of https://gruntwork.io/infrastructure-as-code-library/[the Gruntwork Infrastructure as Code
Library], a collection of reusable, battle-tested, production ready infrastructure code. If you've never used the
Infrastructure as Code Library before, make sure to read

=== Repo organization

* link:/modules[modules]: the main implementation code for this repo, broken down into multiple standalone, orthogonal submodules.
** link:/modules/aurora[modules/aurora]: use this module to deploy all Amazon's Aurora and Aurora Serverless databases.
** link:/modules/efs[modules/efs]: use this module to deploy Amazon Elastic File System (EFS), a file system that
provides NFSv4-compatible storage that can be used with other AWS services, such as EC2 instances.
** link:/modules/backup-vault[modules/backup-vault]: use this module to create and configure AWS Backup vaults, notifications, locks.
** link:/modules/backup-plan[modules/backup-plan]: use this module to create and configure AWS Backup plans, schedules and resource selections.
** link:/modules/lambda-create-snapshot[modules/lambda-create-snapshot]: use this module and the other
`lambda-xxx-snapshot` modules to create custom snapshots of your databases and copy those snapshots to other AWS accounts.
** link:/modules/rds[modules/rds]: use this module to deploy all non-Amazon databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL,
   MariaDB, Oracle, and SQL Server.
** link:/modules/redshift[modules/redshift]: use this module to deploy Amazon Redshift cluster that you can use as a data warehouse.
* link:/examples[examples]: This folder contains working examples of how to use the submodules.
* link:/test[test]: Automated tests for the modules and examples.

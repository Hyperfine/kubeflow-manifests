This module creates an Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) cluster that can run
https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/[Amazon Aurora], Amazon's cloud-native relational database. The cluster is managed by
AWS and automatically handles standby failover, read replicas, backups, patching, and encryption.

= Database backup

This module, along with the link:/modules/lambda-share-snapshot[lambda-share-snapshot] and
link:/modules/lambda-copy-shared-snapshot[lambda-copy-shared-snapshot] modules, can be used to backup your RDS database
to another AWS account (e.g., for disaster recovery) on a configurable schedule. Under the hood, each module runs a
Lambda function that instructs your database to take a snapshot (this module), share the snapshot with another account
(the `lambda-share-snapshot` module), and make a copy of the snapshot (`lambda-copy-shared-snapshot`).

== Features

* Standalone functions for taking snapshots, sharing snapshots, and copying snapshots that can be combined in many
  different ways
* You can combine them to copy snapshots across AWS accounts and regions
* Configurable backup schedule (e.g., using cron expressions)
* Clean up old snapshots automatically using the link:/modules/lambda-cleanup-snapshots[lambda-cleanup-snapshots]
  module.
